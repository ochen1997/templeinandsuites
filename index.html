          The <strong>Provo Utah Temple</strong>(formerly the<strong
            >Provo Temple</strong
          >
          is the 17th constructed and 15th operating temple of The Church of
          Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints. Located in the city of Provo Utah.
          it was built with a mordern single spire design, dimilar to the
          original design of the Ogden Utah Temple.Since Provo's early years, a
          hill just northeast of downtown Provo was known as "Temple Hill."
          Instead of a temple, however, the Maeser Building was built on the
          hill in 1911 as a part of the Brigham Young University (BYU) campus. A
          17-acre (69,000 m2) block of property at the base of Rock Canyon was
          chosen as the site for the Provo Temple.[1] The LDS Church announced
          the intention to construct a temple in Provo on August 14, 1967.</p> 
          <p>A groundbreaking ceremony, to signify the beginning of construction, was held on September 15, 1969. The temple was dedicated on February 9, 1972, by church president Joseph Fielding Smith.</p>

          Emil B. Fetzer, the architect for the Ogden and Provo temples, was
          asked to create a functional design with efficiency, convenience, and
          reasonable cost as key factors. The design of the temple was inspired
          by a scripture in Exodus 13:21 which describes the Lord going before
          the children of Israel by day as a cloud and by night as a pillar of
          fire 
        </p> 
          <p class="dontinmedium">panels on the sides of the temple feature a gothic arch
          motif, commonly used in religious architecture. The temple has 6
          ordinance rooms and 12 sealing rooms, all surrounded by a circular
          hallway, and has a total floor area of 128,325 square feet (11,921.8
          m2).In large part because of its location across the street from a Missionary Training Center and proximity to the BYU campus, the Provo Utah Temple is one of the church's busiest. In 2016, the Provo City Center Temple was dedicated, making Provo the second city, following South Jordan, Utah, to have two active temples in the world.[4] The two temples are 2.4 miles apart
